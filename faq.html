 <div class="headbar"> Frequently asked Questions</div>


 <div id="faqbox">

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>Where are you based?</h3>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are based in Wells, Somerset. Darcey Oliver Cake Couture is a registered home based business.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>Do you deliver?</h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely!  Collection from us is free, otherwise we charge &#163;1 per mile within 25 miles of BA5.  For orders over &#163;300, we can go further afield and will deliver to Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset, Bath & Bristol.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>Do you offer cake tastings? </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes of course - ultimately it's all about the cake! Please contact us to make an appointment. Consultations and tastings are charged at &#163;25 for 2 people, and will be deducted off the final cost of your cake.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>What flavours do you offer?</h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do love a bit of flavour alchemy, and as all of our cakes, frostings, ganache, meringue, preserves and purees are handmade we are happy to offer you whatever you fancy! However look at our <a href="flavours.html">FLAVOURS</a> guide for our most popular cake combinations.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3> What are your prices?</h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each cake we make is a unique commission. It's size, flavour and complexity of design will determine what each cake costs, however have a look at our <a href="PP.html">PORTIONS & PRICING</a> guide to give you some idea.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>I'm not sure how many portions I need! </h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Is your cake intended as a little finger slice with bubbles at the end of a party, or as the main desert event? Our portion guide should help you figure out your sizing. Sculpted & gravity defying cakes are a bit different, as they will vary in size depending purely on the design, but if you let us know how many people you want to cater for we can size accordingly.
   </div>


   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>Can you cater for allergies?</h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, please <a href="contact.html">drop us a line</a> to let us know what you need and we'll do our best to accommodate!
   </div>



   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>How do I place an order? </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly get in touch using the contact form and let us know when you need a cake. We'll let you know if your date is available and once we've discussed ideas (or arranged a consultation) we require a 50% non refundable deposit in order to secure the booking. Please note that a cake is not considered booked without the deposit!
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>How much notice do you need?</h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we work solely on high quality, bespoke commissions we are limited with the amount of orders we can cater for each week. In order to ensure we can provide you with a cake for your event, please contact us at least 4 -6 weeks prior, and anywhere up to 6 - 12 months in advance for a wedding cake.
   </div>

   <div class="questionbox">
   <h3>I'm not sure what design I want! </h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No problem! We can certainly help you brainstorm ideas for your cake. We'll come up with a theme and the rest can spin off from there. All designs are bespoke and designed specifically and only for you. To that end I won't recreate another cake you have seen, although please feel free to send me some of your inspiration. It doesn't have to be cake pics either, fabric and stationery swatches, favourite hobbies, things that inspire the cake recipient, even just a favourite colour are all good starting points.
